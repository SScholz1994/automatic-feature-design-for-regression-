## automatic-feature-design-for-regression

The program Galileo'sRamp.py illustrates how the best possible features for a regression scenario can automatically be designed, here in the case of a polynomial basis. 
The code includes functions to determine the features or weights and to calculate testing errors. Those are used to apply a "leave one out 6-fold cross validation" algorithm. 

To run the program, the experimental data would have to be imported: https://github.com/jermwatt/machine_learning_refined/blob/gh-pages/mlrefined_datasets/superlearn_datasets/galileo_ramp_data.csv#L2 


## origin: 
The code originally was part of a students' seminar talk in the Univerity of Cologne. It was made to get a better understanding of the interrelations of regression.
